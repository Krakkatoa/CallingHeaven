        "For through it all the Virgin remained the adorer of the gift of God! This does not prevent her from spending herself outwardly when it was a matter of charity- never did the ineffable vision that she contemplated within herself in any way diminish her outward charity.",
        
        "No one has penetrated the mystery of Christ in all its depths except the Blessed Virgin.. compared with the light given to Our Lady, the saints remain in shadow. The secret which she kept and pondered in her heart, no tongue can tell, no pen record.  ",
        
        " This Mother is going to form my soul so that her little child may be a living, striking image of her 'First-born', the Eternal Son, the one who was the perfect praise of His Father's glory.",
