    "“Remain in Me \n Remain in Me” (Jn. 15:4). It is the Word of God who gives this order, expresses this wish., \n Remain with Me, not for a few moments,\n a few hours which must pass away, \n but “remain…” permanently, habitually, \n Remain in Me, pray in Me, adore in Me, \n love in Me, suffer in Me, work and act in Me. \n Remain in Me so that you may be able to encounter anyone or anything; penetrate further still into these depths. \n This is truly the “solitude into which God wants to allure the soul that He may speak to it,” as the prophet sang (Hos. 2:14). \n In order to understand this very mysterious saying, \n we must not, so to speak, stop at the surface,  \n but enter ever deeper in the divine Being through recollection. \n I pursue my course,” exclaimed St Paul; \n so must we descend daily  \n this pathway of the Abyss which is God;  \n let us slide down this slope in wholly loving confidence. \n\n Abyss calls to abyss” (Ps. 41:8). \n It is there in the very depths  \n that the divine impact takes place,  \n where the Abyss of our nothingness  \n encounters the Abyss of mercy,  \n the immensity of the all of God.  \n There we will find the strength to die to ourselves  \n and,losing all vestige of self,  \n we will be changed into love.  \n “Blessed are those who die in the Lord” (Ap. 14:13). Amen.",

        "Holy Trinity, Whom I Adore  \n O my God, Trinity whom I adore,  \n let me entirely forget myself  \n that I may abide in You,  \n still and peaceful  \n as if my soul were already in eternity;  \n let nothing disturb my peace  \n nor separate me from You,  \n O my unchanging God,  \n but that each moment may take me further  \n into the depths of Your mystery!  \n Pacify my soul!  \n Make it Your heaven,  \n Your beloved home and place of Your repose;  \n let me never leave You there alone, \n but may I be ever attentive,  \n ever alert in my faith,  \n ever adoring and all given up  \n to Your creative action. \n \n O my beloved Christ, \n crucified for love,  \n would that I might be for You a spouse of Your heart!  \n I would anoint You with glory, \n I would love You - even unto death! \n Yet I sense my frailty and ask You to adorn me with Yourself;  \n identify my soul with all the movements of Your soul,  \n submerge me, overwhelm me,  \n substitute Yourself in me  \n that my life may become but a reflection  \n of Your life.  \n Come into me as Adorer, Redeemer and Savior. \n O Eternal Word,  \n Word of my God,  \n would that I might spend my life listening to You,  \n would that I might be fully receptive  \n to learn all from You;  \n in all darkness,  \n all loneliness, \n all weakness,  \n may I ever keep my eyes fixed on You  \n and abide under Your great light;  \n O my Beloved Star,  \n fascinate me so that  \n I may never be able to leave Your radiance. \n O Consuming Fire, Spirit of Love,  \n descend into my soul  \n and make all in me as an incarnation of the Word,  \n that I may be to Him a super-added humanity  \n wherein He renews His mystery;  \n and You O Father, bestow Yourself  \n and bend down to Your little creature,  \n seeing in her only Your beloved Son  \n in whom You are well pleased. \n  \n O my ”Three”,  \n my All,  \n my Beatitude, \n infinite Solitude,  \n Immensity in whom I lose myself, \n I give myself to You as a prey to be consumed;  \n enclose Yourself in me  \n that I may be absorbed in You  \n so as to contemplate in Your light  \n the abyss of Your Splendor! Amen.",

        "O God, who loves souls so much as to make in them Your dwelling place,  \n I thank You for giving Blessed Elizabeth of the Trinity  \n the grace, during her lifetime,  \n to understand the indwelling \n of the Blessed Trinity in her soul.  \n Grant that I too,  \n may remember your presence in my soul, \n and if it be Your holy will \n  manifest by visible signs  \n the glory she now enjoys with You  \n in heaven,  \n through Christ our Lord.  \n Amen.  \n Bl. Elizabeth of the Trinity, pray for us. Amen.",
        
        
        "Oh how good it is in silence  \n To listen to Him over and over, \n To enjoy the peace of His presence, \n and then to surrender wholly to His love. \n \n O Lamb, so pure and so meek,  \n You my All, my only One,  \n How well you know that your fiancee,  \n Your little one, hungers greatly for You. \n She hungers to feed upon her Master, \n Above all to be consumed by Him, \n To surrender fully to Him her whole being \n So she may be totally taken. \n Oh, that I may be possessed by You, \n One who lives by You alone,\n Yours, your living host \n Consumed by you on the Cross. Amen.",
        
        "O Lord, the desire to listen to Your divine Word , the need to be silent is sometimes so strong that I wish not to know how to do anything else save to remain at Your feet like the Magdalen, in order to penetrate ever more deeply into that mystery of love which You came to reveal to us. Amen.",
        
        "O Lord, what does it matter, when I can retire within myself, enlightened by faith, whether I feel or don’t feel, whether I am in light or darkness, enjoy or do not enjoy?  I am struck by a kind of shame at making any distinction between such things and, despising myself utterly for such want of love, I turn at once to You …above the sweetness and consolations which flow from You, because I have resolved to pass by all else in order to be united with You. Amen.",
        
        "O Jesus, even though I fall at every moment, in trustful faith I shall pray to You to raise me up, and I know that You will forgive me, and will blot out everything with care. More than that: You will deliver me from my miseries, from everything that is an obstacle to Your divine action; and will draw all my powers to Yourself, and make them Your captive…Then I shall have passed completely into You and shall be able to say:It is no longer I that live ; my Master lives in me. Amen.",
        
        "Lord, how i long to labor for Your glory! I long to give myself entirely to You, to be pervaded by Your divine life; be the life of my life, the soul of my soul, and grant that I may always remain under the influence of Your divine action. Amen.",
        
        "O, Jesus, I no longer wish to live by my own life, but be transformed in You, so that my life may be more divine than human, and that, inclining unto me, the Father may recognize Your image, the image of His beloved Son, in whom He is well pleased. Amen.",
        
        "I am praying fervently for you, that God may invade all the powers of your soul, that He may make you live in communion with His whole mystery, that everything in you may be divine and marked with His seal, so that you may be another Christ working for the glory of the Father! …I want to work for the glory of God, and for that I must be wholly filled with Him; then I will be all-powerful: one look, one desire [will] become an irresistible prayer than can obtain everything, since it is, so to speak, God whom we are offering to God.  May our souls be one in Him, and while you bring Him to souls, I will remain like Mary Magdalene, silent and adoring, close to the Master, asking Him to make your word fruitful in souls. Amen.",
        
        "O faithful Virgin, when you uttered your “fiat”, the greatest of all mysteries was accomplished in you.  In what peace and recollection did you live and act! Teach me to sanctify my most trivial actions and to spend myself for others when charity requires it, yet all the while to remain like you the constant adorer of God within me. \n\n O my Guiding Star, the fair light of faith enlightens me to see You.  What does it matter if I feel or do not feel, if I am in the light or darkness, if I enjoy or do not enjoy.  Only let me so fix my gaze on You, that I may never wander from Your light. Amen." ,
    
    "O my God, I ask You to make us genuine in our love, that is, men and women of sacrifice.  It is our mission to prepare the way of the Lord by our union with Him.  In contact with Him our soul will become like a flame of love, spreading through all the members of the body of Christ which is the Church. Amen.",
        
        "O my God, Trinity whom I adore, help me forget myself entirely so to establish myself in you, unmovable and peaceful as if my soul were already in eternity. May nothing be able to trouble my peace or make me leave you, O my unchanging God, but may each minute bring me more deeply into your mystery! Grant my soul peace. Make it your heaven, your beloved dwelling and the place of your rest. May I never abandon you there, but may I be there, whole and entire, completely vigilant in my faith, entirely adoring, and wholly given over to your creative action.",
        
        "Mother of the Word, oh tell me your mystery. \n After the moment of the Incarnation,\n Tell me how you spent your life\n Buried in adoration.",
        
        "At the foot of the Cross, Beloved,\n Jesus, my crucified Love.\n I come to tell you again to take\n My heart without giving it back.",
        
        "O God of bountiful mercy,\n you revealed to Blessed Elizabeth of the Trinity \n the mystery of your secret presence in the hearts of those who love you, \n and you chose her to adore you in spirit and in truth.\n Through her intercession \n may we also abide in the love of Christ,\n that we may merit to be transformed into temples of your life-giving Spirit\n to the praise of your glory.",
