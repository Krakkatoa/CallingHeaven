        "The humble soul becomes light; she lives in the truth, she rises up to God and God lowers Himself to her. Humility gives to that soul a way to achieve other virtues. The proud soul is like a grain of wheat thrown in the water. It swells up and becomes big. Expose this grain to the sun and it will wither. The humble soul is like a grain of wheat thrown on the ground. It descends and hides itself. It disappears and it dies but it is to blossom in heaven.",

        "Look at the earthworm. As long as it stays underground, it is safe. But, if it shows itself, it will be crushed. The worm, when ice comes, the earth is its warmth. When the sun comes, the earth gives it freshness. Understand that humility is happy with everything. She possesses peace in this world and joy in the next world.",
        
        "Reflect well on this: today on the earth, tomorrow under the earth.",
        
        "Little sheep, love the one who slaps you and not the one who gives you kisses. If you defend yourself when someone slaps you, you will lose everything, but if you kiss the one who strikes you, God will keep you.",
        
        "The Lord will not reproach you for having sinned, but for not having humbled yourself.",
        
        "Never look at either the mistakes or the shortcomings of the sisters. Keep to yourself the most difficult, the most painful things, in order to comfort the others. Think always good of others. Excuse them. If you see a sister spilling oil, think that she is lost in God. Then pick up a rag to clean up the spill.",

See the hen and the little chicks? As long as they are small, she feeds them with her beak. she hides them under her wings. They lack nothing. Be small. The Lord will keep you. He will feed you.",
        
        "When Jesus looks at his chosen ones, his gaze melts their hearts. Oh, that look!",
