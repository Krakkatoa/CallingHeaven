        "My soul is occupied, and all my substance in His service. Now I guard no flock, Nor have I any other employment. My sole occupation is love",
        
        "All my occupation now is the practice of the love of God. All the powers of soul and body, memory, understanding, and will, interior and exterior senses, the desires of spirit and of sense, all work in and by love. All I do is done in love; all I suffer, I suffer in the sweetness of love.",
        
        "He who loves is not ashamed before men of what he does for God, neither does he hide it through shame though the whole world should condemn it.",
        
        "Deny your desires and you will find what your heart longs for. For how do you know if any desire of yours is according to God?",
        
        "If you wish to attain holy recollection, you will do so not by receiving but by denying.",
        
        "Souls will be unable to reach perfection who do not strive to be content with having nothing, in such fashion that their natural and spiritual desire is satisfied with emptiness. For this is necessary in order to reach the highest tranquility and peace of spirit. Hence the love of God in the pure and simple soul is almost continually in act.",
        
        "Although you perform many works, if you do not deny your will and submit yourself, losing all solicitude about yourself and your affairs, you will not make progress.",
        
        "The very pure spirit does not bother about the regard of others or human respect, but communes inwardly with God, alone and in solitude as to all forms, and with delightful tranquility, for the knowledge of God is received in divine silence.",
        
        "Love consists not in feeling great things but in having great detachment and in suffering for the Beloved.",
        
        "Strive to preserve your heart in peace; let no event of this world disturb it; reflect that all must come to an end.",
        
        "Whoever flees prayer flees all that is good.",
        
        "If a man wishes to be sure of the road he treads on, he must close his eyes and walk in the dark.",
        
        "It is great wisdom to know how to be silent and to look at neither the remarks, nor the deeds, nor the lives of others",
        
        "Beloved, all that is harsh and difficult I want for myself, and all that is gentle and sweet for thee",
        
        "In tribulation, immediately draw near to God with confidence and you will receive strength, enlightenment, and instruction.",
        
        "If you purify your soul of attachment to and desire for things, you will understand them spiritually. If you deny your appetite for them, you will enjoy their truth, understanding what is certain in them.",
        
        "He who interrupts the course of his spiritual exercises and prayer is like a man who allows a bird to escape from his hand. He can hardly catch it again",
        
        "Abide in peace, banish cares, take no account of all that happens, and you will serve God according to his good pleasure and rest in him.",
        
        "The soul that is attached to anything, however much good there may be in it, will not arrive at the liberty of divine union. For whether it be a strong wire rope or a slender and delicate thread that holds the bird, it matters not, if it really holds it fast; for, until the cord be broken the bird cannot fly",
        
        "To saints, their very slumber is a prayer",
        
        "The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. The soul has to proceed rather by unknowing rather than knowing.",
        "The soul is wearied and fatigued by its desires. The (desires) disturb it, allowing it not to rest in any place or in any thing whatsoever. The desires and indulgence in them all cause it greater emptiness and hunger.",
        
        "The soul that is clouded by the desires is darkened in the understanding and allows neither the sun of natural reason nor that of the supernatural Wisdom of God to shine upon it and illumine it clearly.",
        
        "Faith is a dark night for man, but in this very way it gives him light.",
        "Time is but a shadow, a dream. Already God sees us in glory and takes joy in our eternal beatitude. How this thought helps my soul! I understand then why He lets us suffer.",
        
        "In the evening of life, we will be judged on love alone.",
        "By thy sweet breathing, how delicately thou inspirest love to me.",
        
        "It is great wisdom to know how to be silent and to look at neither the remarks, nor the deeds, nor the lives of others.",
        
        "Desolation is a file, and the endurance of darkness is preparation for great light.",
        
        "The soul that is attached to anything however much good there may be in it, will not arrive at the liberty of divine union. For whether it be a strong wire rope or a slender and delicate thread that holds the bird, it matters not, if it really holds it fast; for, until the cord be broken the bird cannot fly.",
        
        "Take God for your spouse and friend and walk with him continually, and you will not sin and will learn to love, and the things you must do will work out prosperously for you.",
        
        "I abandoned and forgot myself, laying my face on my Beloved; all things ceased; I went out from myself, leaving my cares forgotten among the lilies.",
        
        "Reveal Thy presence, and let the vision and Thy beauty kill me. Behold the malady of love is incurable, except in Thy presence and before Thy face.",
        
        "He who loves is not ashamed before men of what he does for God, neither does he hide it through shame though the whole world should condemn it.",
        
        "One human thought alone is worth more than the entire world, hence God alone is worthy of it.",
        
        "The very pure spirit does not bother about the regard of others or human respect, but communes inwardly with God, alone and in solitude as to all forms, and with delightful tranquility, for the knowledge of God is received in divine silence.",
        
        " Souls will be unable to reach perfection who do not strive to be content with having nothing, in such fashion that their natural and spiritual desire is satisfied with emptiness.",
        
        "...For this is necessary in order to reach the highest tranquility and peace of spirit- Hence the love of God in the pure and simple soul is almost continually in act.",
        
        "Live in the world as though only God and yourself were in it. Then your heart will never be made captive by any earthly thing.",
        
        "He who seeks the cross of Christ seeks not the glory of Christ.",
        
        "Speak little and do not meddle in other's matters about which you are not asked.",
        
        "If a person is seeking God, his Beloved is seeking him much more.",
        
        "In the evening of life, we will be judged on love alone.",
        
        "Let your speech be such that no one may be offended, and let it concern things that would not ause you regret were all to know of them.",
        
        "Since, when the hour of reckoning comes, you will be sorry for not having used this time in the service of God, why do you not arrange and use it now as you would wish to have done were you dying?",
        
        "O Living flame of love that tenderly wounds my soul in its deepest center! Since now you are oppressive now consumate! If it be your will, tear through the veil of this sweet encounter!",
        
        "To be taken with love for a soul, God does not look on its greatness, but the greatness of its humility.",
        
        "Conquering the tongue is better than fasting on bread and water.",
        
        "If a man wishes to be sure of the road he treads on, he must close his eyes and walk in the dark.",
        
        "Now that I no longer desire it all, I have it all, without desire.",
        
        "Whoever knows how to die in all will have life in all.",
        
        "All the gifts of the Holy Spirit, first and last, great and small, which God grants the soul, He always grants in order to lead it to eternal life.",
        
        "Be hostile to admitting into your soul things that of themselves have no spiritual substance, lest they make you lose your liking for devotion and recollection.",
        
        "I didn't know you, my Lord, because I still desired to know and relish things.",
        
        "The appetites are leeches, always calling, 'Give more, give more.'",
        
        "Blessed are they who set aside their own inclincations and consider things according to reason and justice before doing them.",
        
        "Love works so in me that whether things go well or badly, love turns all to one sweetness.",
        
        "Travelers cannot reach new territory if they do not taken new and unknown roads and abandon the familiar ones.",
        
        "Take God for your spouse and friend and walk with him continually, and you will not sin and will learn to love, and the things you must do will work out prosperously for you.",
        
        "Whenever anything disagreeable or displeasing happens to you, remember Christ crucified and be silent.",
        
        "In the dark night of the soul, bright flows the river of God.",
        
        "And I saw the river over which every soul must pass to reach the kingdom of heaven and the name of that river was suffering: and I saw a boat which carries souls across the river and the name of that boat was love.",
        
        "Take neither great nor little notice of who is with you or against you, and try aways to please god. Ask Him that His will be done in you.",
        
        "What we need most in order to make progress is to be silent before this great God with our appetite and with our tongue, for the language He best hears is silent love.",
        
        "The light of grace which God gives to the soul, opening its eyes to behold the Divine light, and making it pleasing to Himself, calls to ever greater depths of grace, which will ultimately transform the soul to God.",
        
        "We must be truly resolved to suffer willingly for the love of God in all things.",
        
        "Be deeply sorry for any time that is lost or passes without your loving God.",
        
        "Faith and love are like the blind man's guides. They will lead you along a path unknown to you, to the place where God is hidden.",
        
        "Abide in peace, banish cares, take no account of all that happens and you will serve God according to his good pleasure and rest in Him.",
        
        "I did not have to ask my heart what it wanted because of all the desires I have ever known, just one did I cling to, for it was the essence of all desire: to know beauty.",
        
        "Extinguish these miseries, since no one else can stamp them out; and may my eyes behold you, because you are their light- and I would open them to you alone.",
        
        "Do not feed your soul on anything apart from God. Cast away all cares and let peace and recollection fill your heart.",
