        "True humility doesn't come to the soul with agitation and disturbance, nor does it darken it or bring it dryness. Rather, true humility consoles and acts in a completely opposite way: Quiet, gently and with light.",

        "I don't say that they shouldn't strive carefully to remain in God's presence, but that if they can't even get a good thought... they shouldn't kill themselves. We are useless servants. What do we think we can do?",

        "For I never lost confidence in his mercy. In myself, I lost it many times.",
        
        "It (the soul) sees clearly that everything other than pleasing God is nothing.",

        "The intellect, if it understands, doesn't understand how it understands. At least it can't comprehend anything of what it understands. It doesn't seem to me that it understands, because, as I say, it doesn't understand- I really CAN'T understand this.",

        "All the problems of life begin when we start to imagine that God is not near.",
        
        "One must not think that a person who is suffering is not praying. He is offering up his sufferings to God, and many a time he is praying much more truly than one who goes away by himself and meditates his head off, and, if he has squeezed out a few tears, thinks that is prayer.",

        "Humility does not disturb or disquiet or agitate, however great it may be; it comes with peace, delight, and calm. The pain of genuine humility doesn’t agitate or afflict the soul; rather, this humility expands it and enables it to serve God more.",
    
    "My director, Jesus, does not teach me to count my acts, but to do everything for love, to refuse Him nothing, to be pleased when He gives me a chance to prove to Him that I love Him - but all this in peace - in abandonment.",
        
        "So dearly does His Majesty love us that He will reward our love for our neighbor by increasing the love which we bear to Himself, and that in a thousand ways.",
        
        "I know the power obedience has of making things easy which seem impossible.",
        
        "I often thought my constitution would never endure the work I had to do, (but) the Lord said to me: ‘Daughter, obedience gives strength.'",
        
        "One of the greatest graces for which I feel myself indebted to Our Lord is, that His Divine Majesty has given me the desire to be obedient; for in this virtue I find most consolation and contentment, it being that which Our Lord recommended by His own example more than any other, and on this account I desire to possess it more than anything else in the world.",

        "There are more tears shed over answered prayers than over unanswered prayers.",
        
        "The most potent and acceptable prayer is the prayer that leaves the best effects. I don't mean it must immediately fill the soul with desire. The best effects (are) those that are followed up by actions, when the soul not only desires the honor of God, but really strives for it.",
        
        "How often I failed in my duty to God, because I was not leaning on the strong pillar of prayer.",

    "Jacob did not cease to be a Saint because he had to attend to his flocks.",
        
        "Anyone who has the habit of speaking before God's majesty as if he were speaking to a slave, careless about how he is speaking, and saying whatever comes into his head and whatever he's learned from saying prayers at other times, in my opinion is not praying. Please, God, may no Christian pray in this way.",
        
        "I would never want any prayer that would not make the virtues grow within me.",
        
        "Let him never cease from prayer who has once begun it, be his life ever so wicked; for prayer is the way to amend it, and without prayer such amendment will be much more difficult.",
    
    "Vocal prayer must be accompanied by reflection. A prayer in which a person is not aware of Whom he is speaking to, what he is asking, who it is who is asking and of Whom, I don't call prayer, however much the lips may move.",
        
        "Much more is accomplished by a single word of the Our Father said, now and then, from our heart, than by the whole prayer repeated many times in haste and without attention.",
    
    "Holiness is a disposition of the heart that makes us humble and little in the arms of God, aware of our weakness, and confident, in the most audacious way,in His Fatherly goodness.",
        
        "His Majesty (the Lord) rewards great services with trials, and there can be no better reward, for out of trials springs love for God.",
        
"The more we see that any action springs not from the motive of obedience, the more evident is it that it is a temptation of the enemy; for when God sends an inspiration, the very first effect of it is to infuse a spirit of docility.",
        
        "All that the beginner in prayer has to do -- and you must not forget this, for it is very important -- is to labour and be resolute and prepare himself with all possible diligence to bring his will into conformity with the will of God. As I shall say later, you may be quite sure that this comprises the very greatest perfection which can be attained on the spiritual road.",
        
       "The goal of all our undertakings should be not so much a task perfectly completed as the accomplishment of the will of God.",
        
        "We can only learn to know ourselves and do what we can- namely, surrender our will and fulfill God's will in us.",
        
        "With so good a Friend and Captain ever present, Himself the first to suffer, everything can be borne. He helps, He strengthens, He never fails, He is the true Friend."  ,
        
        "I am not asking you to make many reflections, to produce grand and subtle considerations with your intellect, or to feel deep devotion: I only ask you to look at Him.",
        
        "He does not force our wills but only takes what we give Him, but He does not give Himself entirely until He sees that we yield ourselves entirely to Him.",
        
        "Had I understood always, as I do now, that so great a King resided in my soul, I should not have left Him alone so often, but should have stayed with Him sometimes and not kept His dwelling place in such disorder.",
        
        "He wills that we desire only what is safe; We love danger. All things are vanity, save to ask God to deliver us from these dangers forever and to preserve us now from all evil.",
        
        "Before prayer, endeavor to realize Whose Presence you are approaching and to Whom you are about to speak, keeping in mind Whom you are addressing.",
        
        "May it please His Majesty to give us His love before He takes us out of this life, for it will be a great thing at the hour of death to see that we are going to be judged by the One whom we have loved above all things.",
        
        "We shall never completely know ourselves if we don't strive to know God.",
        
        "Christ has no body now but yours \n No hands, no feet on earth but yours \n Yours are the eyes through which He looks \n Compassion on this world \n Yours are the feet with which He walks to do good \n Yours are the hands with which He blesses all the world \n Yours are the hands \n Yours are the feet \n Yours are the eyes \n You are His body \n Christ has no body now on earth but yours.",
        
        "In the presence of Jesus in the Holy Sacrament we ought to be like the Blessed in heaven before the Divine Essence.",
        
        "Vocal prayer must be accompanied by reflection. A prayer in which a person is not aware of to Whom he is speaking, what he is asking, who it is who is asking and of Whom, I don't call prayer, no matter how much the lips may move.",
        
        "Oh, how I suffer now when I recall how I forgot the longings of my childhood! My God, since you seem to have decided to rescue me, let it be your glorious will to do so.... Why did this soul, which you have selected for your habitation and showered with grace, become spotted like this? I feel great pain remembering it, for I know very well that I alone was guilty. You, Oh Lord, have left nothing untried to open my eyes ever since my youngest days.",
        
        "Mental prayer in my opinion is nothing more than an intimate sharing between friends; it means taking time frequently to be alone with Him who we know loves us.",
        
        "O my God, You give me the keenest desire not to displease You in any respect whatsoever, however trivial, or to commit so much as an imperfection if I could avoid doing so.  For this reason alone, if for no other, I would like to flee from other people, and I envy those who live, or have lived, in deserts.  On the other hand, I would like to plunge right into the heart of the world, to see if by doing this I could help even one soul to praise God more.",
        
        "May He be blessed forever Who waited for me so long!" ,
        
        "Always think of yourself as everyone's servant; look for Christ our Lord in everyone, and you will then have respect and reverence for them all.",
