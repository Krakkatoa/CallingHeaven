    "The one who would be called later Teresa de Los Andes was born in Santiago, Chile, on July 13, 1900. Fifth child of don Miguel Fernández Jaraquemada and doña Lucía Solar Armstrong, she received at baptism the name of Juanita.\n\n Juanita's family was wealthy. Her paternal grandfather was native from Spain. Her motherly grandfather, don Eulogio, had a very large estate in Chacabuco, about forty miles north of Santiago, where he used to gather often his family.\n\nDuring vacations Juanita goes often to Chacabuco which she likes very much. Very early she learned to ride a horse. As a genuine horsewoman she would ride through the estate up to the beginning of the Andes cordillera.\n\n Juanita's brothers and sisters were: Lucita, Miguel, Luis (Lucho), Juana (who died a few hours after birth and whose name was given to Juanita), Rebeca and Ignacio. Juanita was particularly close to her brother Lucho and to her inseparable sister Rebeca.\n\nVery early Juanita felt attracted toward God. She liked to go to church with Ofelia (the servant girl who used to take care of her). One day, being in Chacabuco, she took the hand of a priest friend of the family and told him: ”Father, let us go to heaven!” When they were out of the house the priest asked her: ”Now, Juanita, where is the way leading to heaven?”Juanita answered: ”This way,'pointing toward the Andes cordillera. The priest told her: ”After climbing the high mountains heaven shall still be far, very far. No, Juanita, this is not the way leading to heaven. Jesus in the tabernacle is the royal way to reach there.”\n\n Now Juanita did not have an easy character. She was conceited, did not like to obey, would easily become angry (her brothers enjoyed let her become angry) and cry for nothing. With the help of God's grace, especially through the Eucharist, Juanita shall progressively learn to overcome her defects and control herself.\n\n In 1906 an earthquake shook the city of Santiago. In her Diary Juanita wrote that it was at this time that Jesus began to take possession of her heart.\n\n Juanita's grand father died a holy death in 1907. Juanita's mother, doña Lucía, inherited a part of the Chacabuco estate which was managed by Don Miguel, Juanita's father. The same year Juanita entered Sacred Heart school in Santiago, a school run by the Sisters of Sacred Heart of St. Madeleine-Sophie Barat.\n\n It was Lucho who taught Juanita how to pray the rosary. Both made the promise to pray it every day, a promise Juanita kept until her death (only one time, she writes, being very small, she forgot). ”From that time on, one can say that Our Lord took me by hand with the most holy Virgin.”\n\n Quickly Juanita felt a great desire to do her first communion. She would often ask when she would be able to do it but would be told that she was too young. Then she would ask to be taught to do communions of desire. After insisting a lot Juanita was admitted to first communion. She wanted to prepare herself through confession and prayer, offering many little sacrifices to Jesus. ”I prepared myself for one year. During that time the Virgin helped me to purify my heart from all imperfections.” She did her first communion on September 11, 1910, in Santiago. In her Diary she wrote about this event which impressed her for life. She would try as much as possible to receive communion every day.\n\n In 1914 Juanita reads for the first time Story of a Soul of Thérèse of Lisieux (who was not yet beatified). For several years, approaching December 8, Juanita becomes seriously ill. In 1914 she has an appendicitis surgery, a delicate and dangerous thing at that time, all the more because Juanita does not have a strong health. Then she hears the call of Christ inviting her to give herself totally to him and to become Carmelite. During the year 1915 Juanita becomes a boarding student with her sister Rebeca at Sacred Heart high school. She suffers much to leave her family house since she loves very much her family. She understands nonetheless that the Lord is preparing her for the great separation when she shall enter the Carmel. Actually, she shall appreciate the school which enables her to live a fervent Christian life. \n\n She begins to write her Diary, nourishes and strengthens her spiritual life through silent prayer, daily mass and sacrifice. Although she is no exceptional student, she dedicates herself totally to her studies, including in topics she does not like (such as physics and chemistry) in order to please Jesus and her parents. She likes also to help poor or less gifted students. Very early Juanita shows a great love for poor people and helps them as much as she can. It was in this same year (1915) that she met in the street a child in rags hungry and shivering with cold. She introduced him into her house, gave him to eat and asked him where he lived. She discovered that the child was living in a slum in Santiago's suburb. She visited his family and until her entrance into Carmel in 1919, took care of him, calling him Juanito, having him eat in her family house and giving him clothes from her brothers. She went as far as organizing a riffle whose prize was her watch in order to earn money to buy shoes for Juanito. She took care of his human and Christian education. On December 1915 Juanita pronounces a private vow of chastity, promising not to have any other spouse than Jesus Christ. She shall renew this vow several times.\n\n Juanita spends her vacations in Chacabuco where she has a true apostolate among the farmer's families, gathering people for the missions, doing catechism for the children, playing with them, organizing a choir, consecrating houses to the Sacred Heart. She has a gift to transmit to children the truths of faith. Due to bad management from Juanita's father, the Chacabuco estate is sold in 1917 and Juanita's family must adopt a simpler way of life. While the family mourns the loss of Chacabuco, Juanita sees in this painful event a providential call to detach herself from earthly goods. On June 15, 1917, Juanita becomes Child of Mary and shall during her entire life keep a strong spiritual bond with Mary to whom she entrusts everything. She reads the spiritual writings of sister Elizabeth of the Trinity (a French Carmelite who died in 1906 in Dijon and would be beatified in 1984) with whom she discovers a great spiritual affinity. She tries to live as much as possible in the presence of God whom she loves more and more. She told her brother Lucho: ”What do you want, Lucho, Christ, this mad of love, made me mad.” In September of 1917 she enters in touch for the first time with the Carmel of Los Andes, having the interior conviction that it is the place where God is calling her.\n\n In August of 1918 Juanita leaves Sacred Heart school to substitute in the family house her elder sister Lucia who just got married. She dedicates herself to her task and accepts any sacrifice for her family's happiness: ”I did not believe that family life was a life of sacrifices. This helped me to prepare myself for religious life.” Her brother Lucho shall say that she was ”the jewel of the house.” Juanita wrote in her Diary: ”I must strive to look for the happiness of all. My resolution is to sacrifice myself for all.” \n\n While having a very intense spiritual life Juanita lives as a young girl of her time. She likes to be with her family and friends. She enjoys sport very much, especially swimming (where she excels) and tennis which she discovers with enthusiasm. She enjoys the beauty of the see and of the mountains. The human and the supernatural build in her an increasingly harmonious synthesis: she as a very deep contemplation of the mystery of God in silent prayer, while being natural, kind and joyful with her friends. Albeit she suffers often because of her poor health and of spiritual purifications in her heart coming from God's grace, Juanita is joyful and likes to joke.\n\n In January of1919 she visits for the first time the Carmel ofLos Andes. There she receives the confirmation that it is the place where God is calling her.\n\n On March 25, 1919, she writes a magnificent letter to her father to ask for permission to enter the Carmel, telling him that since her childhood she searched for happiness but understood that only God could make her completely happy for ever. She wishes to belong totally to him in a life dedicated to prayer and penance. Deeply moved, her father in tears grants her permission. Then Juanita feels in her heart at the same time the greatest joy and the greatest suffering: joy because she shall consecrate herself totally to Christ who attracts her so much, suffering because she shall leave her family she loves so much and which shall suffer a lot from the separation. \n\n On May 7, 1919, she enters the Carmel of Los Andes and receives the name of Teresa de Jesús (Teresa of Jesus).\n\n Entered into the Carmel of Los Andes on May 7, 1919, Teresa begins her postulancy, first step of her religious life. She enjoys in her heart a very deep joy for having given herself totally to God, renouncing what was dearest to her (her family) in order to follow Christ. From the beginning she strives to fulfill the Carmelite rule with perfection, great fidelity and love, offering herself for the humblest and most disagreeable works. She thinks that Carmelite life consists in three things: to love, to suffer and to pray for the conversion of sinners, the sanctification of priests and the Church. \n\n With the permission of her prioress, who understands that the new postulant is an exceptional soul, Teresa has an intense epistolary activity. Her letters radiate the love of Christ and the joy to fully belong to him. Touched by her witness, several of her friends shall enter religious life.\n\n On September 8, 1919, Teresa is accepted to the novitiate and the reception of the habit. She receives it on October 14, 1919, in the presence of her family and of many friends. All the witness are impressed by her radiating joy. \n\n Teresa receives in her monastery many graces of union to God, although she is not exempt from spiritual trials, especially temptations and spiritual dryness. She has a privileged relationship with her prioress, but the prioress' assistant for the novitiate makes her suffer a lot by constantly correcting her. \n\n In the first days of March, 1920, Teresa tells the confessor that she has only one month more to live on earth. She asks him for permission to do extraordinary penances. The confessor does not believe her (how could she know the time of her death?) and tells her to be satisfied with observing the Carmelite rule with perfection. Teresa is stricken by an illness which she knows shall lead her to death. Nonetheless she participates in all the spiritual exercises of Lent that year, including the rigorous fasting. \n\n On Good Friday, April 2, 1920, Teresa begins her way of the cross following Christ. She spends many hours in prayer in the choir. The sisters notice that she has a burning fever and tell her to go to bed. Several physicians examine her without managing to diminish the fever which devours her. Their diagnostic is an advanced typhus. \n\n On April 7, Teresa has the joy of pronouncing her religious vows in articulo mortis: according to the custom, a novice in danger of death can pronounce her vows (however, if she recovers, she must return to the novitiate).\n\n After great physical and spiritual sufferings, Teresa surrenders her soul to God and dies on April 12, 1920, at 7:15 pm. For a Carmelite death has (no meaning.) She is going to enter true life, to fall into the arms of the one who she has loved above everything on earth, to be eternally immersed in love. \n\n The burial is celebrated on April 14. The sisters and the family are surprised to see the convent's chapel flooded by people who, although they have not known Teresa, come to venerate the little saint who just died, as they say. Thus Teresa's fame of holiness is immediate and shall grow in the following years. The sisters receive very quickly many testimonies coming from people who received graces through Teresa's intercession.\n\n On November 23, 1920, the young sister of Teresa, Rebeca, enters the Carmel of Los Andes, convinced that God is calling her to substitute her sister in the community. She shall valiantly follow in the footsteps of Teresa until her holy death in 1942. \n\n Biography used by permission of Carmel of Mary and Joseph, Varroville NSW. http://www.teresadelosandes.org",
