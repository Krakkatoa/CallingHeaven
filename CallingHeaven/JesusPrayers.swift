"My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, Your will be done. (Matthew 26:42)",

"Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners. Get up, let us be going; behold, the one who betrays me is at hand!” (Matthew 26:45-46)",

"Put your sword back into its place; for all those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword.

How then will the Scriptures be fulfilled, which say that it must happen this way? (Matthew 26:52-54)",

"You have said it yourself; nevertheless I tell you, hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven. (Matthew 26:64)",

"My God, My God, why have you forsaken me? (Matthew 27:46)",

Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age. (Matthew 28:18-20)",
