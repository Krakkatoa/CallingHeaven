        "How I'd love to show you the lovely infinite horizon beyond creation that I experience and contemplate. I love God now a thousand times more than I did before.. He reveals and makes Himself known to souls that really seek to know and love Him. Everything on earth... seems to shrink, to lose value before the Divinity which, like an infinite Sun, continues to shine upon my miserable soul with its rays.",
        
        " If a man is capable of making a woman fall in love with him to the point that she leaves everything, do you not believe, that God is capable of making His call irresistible to me?",
        
        
        "I long to love, but that something I love doesn't change and is not a plaything of my passions or of circumstances of time and life. To love, yes, but an unchangeable Being, God, who has loved me infinitely from eternity.",
        
        "What an abyss there is between that pure, disinterested and immutable love, and the love a man can offer me! How can I love a being so filled with misery and weakness? What security can I find in that kind of a heart? To unite myself with another being who can not perfect me with his love, do you think this holds noble prospects for me? No. In God I find everything that I don't find in creatures, because they're too small to satisfy the almost infinite aspirations of my soul.",
        
        "I've become famous for my fits of laughter. (I outdid Chopi Salas). We've done nothing but kid around. Prepare yourself. We are the last ones at table with Pepe. We've told so many jokes and laughed so much that sometimes I can't eat. And the most tragic part of it was that the priest who said grace after the meal had to stop his prayer halfway through. He was unable to continue because of the laughter and because we infected him with our laughter.",

        "I abyss myself in His magnificence and His wisdom but when I ponder His goodness, my heart can say nothing - I can only adore.",
        
        "Let us thank God to have united our souls by the bond of true friendship, which consists in mutually perfecting ourselves to get closer to God.",
        
        "In seeing You so pure, so tender, and so compassionate, who would not be encouraged to unburden his intimate sufferings to you? Who would not ask you to be his star on this stormy see? Who is there who would not cry in your arms without instantly receiving your immaculate kisses of love and comfort? If he be a sinner, your caresses will soften him. If one of your devoted ones, your presence would enkindle the living flame of divine love. If he be poor, you with your powerful hand will aid him and show him his true homeland. If rich, you will sustain him with your breath against the dangers of his very agitated life. If one is in affliction, you with your tearful gaze will show him the cross and on it your Divine Son. Who will not find balm for his pains by considering the torments of Jesus and Mary? The sick man finds in your maternal heart the water of salvation that allows your enchanting smile to blossom forth, and makes him smile with love and happiness.",

        "After Communion we have everything. We have Him whole and entire, because we have God who is our heaven in this exile. You will tell me that you feel nothing of this happiness. But I ask you: how have you prepared for it? Have you delved into God's grandeur, into the infinite love He demonstrates by reducing Himself to a host?",
        
        "When you go to Communion, reflect on what you are about to do: receive a completely eternal Being who doesn't need you, since He is all powerful, an immense Being before whom the angels with their purity tremble. He comes, filled with infinite love for you, a poor creature full of sin and misery.",
        
        "Among the many people in the world, you are honored with a visit by that great King. Still more, that you may draw near to receive Him, He casts aside His splendor, and, under the form of bread, the simplest form of nourishment, He unites Himself to His poor creature and makes Himself one with her. And while He's afire with infinite love, she remains cold and indifferent and shows no gratitude for so signal a favor.",
        
        "You've never known the heaven that I, through God's mercy, possess in my heart. Yes. I have a heaven in my soul, because God is there, and God is heaven.",
        
        "Oh, if you could go to the depths of my soul even for an instant, you'd see me captivated by that Beauty, by that incomprehensible Goodness. How I'd love to bind the hearts of creatures and surrender them to divine Love!",
        
        
        "Each day Jesus nourishes me with His adorable Body and, together with this delicate food, I hear a sweet and soft voice like the harmonious echoes of the angels of heaven. This a the voice that guides me, that loosens the sails of the ship of my soul. And in my pains, in my temptations, He is my Consoler, He is my Captain.",
        
        "Does it ever happen to you that when you're looking at the ocean you feel a longing for the infinite? We feel in our soul an inexplicable loneliness that only God can fill, because everything seems so very small.",
        
        "Can it be that you don't realize that my heart is being perfected by divine love and that, the more perfect it becomes, the more and greater love becomes? So never doubt that at every moment I'm praying for you, and my prayer is a song of love.",
        
        "To the extent that we know this God made man, we come to love him madly. I would like you to know him in order to be truly in love with him… How not to love this Jesus of our soul? He is uncreated Beauty, eternal Wisdom, Goodness, Life, Love… Oh! Love Jesus. Who can love you better? He thirsts for your heart." ,
        
        "I am happy and shall never cease to be so because I belong to my God. At every moment I find in him my heaven and an eternal and immutable love. I don't desire anything but him and this love grows in my soul inasmuch I see myself introduced in the the bosom of his divine love and adorable perfections.",
        
        "I am the happiest creature in the world. God is infinite joy.",
        
        "I wanted to be happy and searched for happiness everywhere. I dreamed of being very rich, but I saw that over night rich people can become poor. And even if at times it doesn't happen, one sees that on the one hand riches abound, and on the other hand, people are overwhelmed by poverty of affection and unity. I've thought of happiness in the affection of a perfect young man, but the very idea that some day he might love me with less enthusiasm or that he could die, leaving me alone in the struggles of life, makes me reject the idea that by marrying I'll be happy. No. This doesn't satisfy me. For me, happiness is not found there. Where, then, I ask myself, is it to be found? Then I understood that I hadn't been born for earthly things but for eternal ones. Why go on denying this fact any longer? Only in God has my heart found its rest. With God my soul found itself fully satisfied, so that I desire nothing in this world but to belong to Him completely.",
