"Our Lord showed me the goal of sanctity. I was to attain this by doing all things as well as I possibly could." ,

"Ah, Mother! You cannot imagine what Jesus was doing in my soul. At that time, I did not live in myself; it was Jesus who was living in me.",

"With all my soul, I asked my Lord that He would give me courage and serenity. What would have become of me without the help of Jesus? Oh, my most sweet Jesus, I love you!",

"...The first time somebody sent me flowers, I remembered to give them to Jesus. The sacrifice cost me dearly, but I made it.",

"What have I done to please that omnipotent King and most merciful Creator who created me?",

"Consequently, my heart, through knowing this Captain, has fallen under the spell of His love and he has kept me captive. Oh how I love this prison and this powerful King who keeps me captive.",

"This is the voice that guides me, that loosens the sails of the ship of my soul so I will not perish, will not sink." ,

"I always hear that dear voice, which is the voice of my Beloved, the voice of Jesus in the depths of my soul. And in my pains, in my temptations, He is my Consoler, He is my Captain." ,

"This is what I would like: to repay them by taking care of them for all they have done for me. But the voice of God is demanding more and I must follow Jesus to the end of the world if He desires it. And all the rest, outside of Him, is shadow, affliction and vanity.",

"But I only desire what fulfills the will of God. He knows best what is fitting for me. Oh Jesus, I love You; I adore You with all my soul!",

"This cruel incertitude is like a torment for my soul. Because in this way it is better for me to unite myself to my Jesus in the Garden and console Him a little. It is the chalice that is approaching my lips, yet I believe that He will not force it on me." ,

"It seems that suddenly, my heart is breaking. Jesus told me that He wants me to suffer with joy.",

"Suffering pleases me for two reasons: first, because Jesus always preferred suffering, from His birth till His death on the cross. It must be something very great because He, the all-powerful One, seeks suffering in all things.",

"(Suffering) pleases me because in the crucible of suffering, souls are formed." ,
    
"My mirror must be Mary. Given that I am her daughter, I must resemble her and thus I must resemble Jesus." ,

" I must only love Jesus. Then my heart must hold the seal of the love of God. My eyes must be fixed on Jesus Crucified. My eyes must constantly attend to the voice of the Divine Crucified One." ,

"To You, my Jesus, I offer this pain, since I want to suffer to become like unto You, Jesus my love.",

"My tongue must tell Him my love.",
