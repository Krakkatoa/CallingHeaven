        "Living in a Eucharistic way means coming out of oneself, out of the narrowness of one's life, and growing into the immensity of life in Christ.",
        
        "Let go of your plans. The first hour of your morning belongs to God. Tackle the day's wake that he charges you with, and he will give you the power to accomplish it.",
        
       
        
        "The motive, principle and end of the religious life is to make an absolute gift of self to God in a self-forgetting love, to end one's own life in order to make room for God's life.",
        
        "Those who remain silent are responsible.",
        
        "In order to be an image of God, the spirit must turn to what is eternal, hold it in spirit, keep it in memory and by loving it, embrace it in the will.",

        "If anyone comes to me, I want to lead them to Him.",
        
        "My longing for truth was a single prayer.",
        
        "Lay all your cares about the future trustingly in God's hands, and let yourself be guided by the Lord just like a little child.",
        
        "The limitless loving devotion to God and the gift God makes of Himself to you, are the highest elevation of which the heart is capable; It is the highest degree of prayer. The souls that have reached this point are truly the heart of the Church.",
        
        "The deepest longing of a woman's heart is to give herself lovingly, to belong to another, and to possess this other being completely... but this surrender becomes a perverted self-abandon and a form of slavery when it is given to another person and not to God.",
        
        "When we entrust all the troubles of our earthly existence confidently to the divine heart, we are relieved of them. Then our soul is free to participate in the divine life.",
        
        "Every finite creature can reflect only a fraction of the divine nature; thus, in the diversity of His creatures, God's infinity, unity and oneness appear to be broken into an effulgence of manifold rays.",
        
        "The complete surrender of an entire life and being is to live and work with Christ, but that also means to suffer and die with Him- that fruitful death from which springs the life of grace for all humanity.",
        
        "No book learning can give this acuteness of vision to our blind sight, no straining of the will can provide the energy to clip the wild shoots within ourselves and those dear to us. Supernatural means now come to our help.",
        
        "It is most important that the Holy Eucharist becomes life's focal point: that the Eucharistic Savior is the center of existence; that every day is received from His hand and laid back therein; that the day's happenings are deliberated with Him.",
        
        "Whoever is imbued with a lively faith in Christ present in the tabernacle knows that a friend waits here constantly.",

        "A woman's heart should be so lost in God that a man must seek Him in order to find her.",

        "Living in a Eucharistic way means coming out of oneself, out of the narrowness of one's life, and growing into the immensity of Christ.",
        
        
        "If one is intent of having all of one's life consist exclusively of sacrifices, the danger of pharisaism is around the corner.",
        
        "Should we strive for perfect love, you ask? Absolutely. For this we were created. Perfect love will be our eternal life and here we have to seek to come as close to it as possible.",
        
    "This can be said very simply, but the work of an entire life would not attain the goal were God not to do the most essential. In the mean time, we may be confident that he will not fail to give grace if we faithfully do the little we can do.",
        
        "What we recognize of ourselves and of our thoughts and behavior is only the illuminated surface. The depth they come out of is from a large extent hidden from ourselves. God knows that depth and can purify it.",
        
        "Jesus became incarnate in order to be our Way. What can we do? Try with all our might to be empty: the senses mortified; the memory as free as possible from the images of this world and, through hope, directed toward Heaven...",
        
        "He who seeks the truth, whether he is aware of it or not, is seeking God.",
        
        "My being, as I see it and as I see myself in it, is null. By myself I am not and I am nothing. By myself, at each moment I am faced with nothingness and I ought to receive being anew, moment by moment. And yet 'being' is exactly this non-being, and therefore each moment, I touch the fullness of being.",
        
        "I know I am being sustained and herein lies my tranquility and security- not the conscious security of the man who is on firm ground with his own strength but the sweet and beautiful security of the child upheld by a strong arm.",
        
        "To be able to give ourselves to God with love, we have to recognize Him as He who loves.",
        
        "The most intimate essence of love is the giving. God, who is love, gives Himself to creatures whom He Himself has created through love.",
        
        "He who gives himself to God attains in union of love with Him the greatest fullness of his own being, which at the same time is knowledge, gift of the heart, and free act.",
        
        "It is the way of faith, more than philosophy, that gives us God: that God who is personally close to us, loving and merciful, and who gives us a security that no natural knowledge can give.",
        
        "This is the life of faith: God who manifests Himself as He who is, as Creator, as Upholder; and when the Savior said he who believes in the Son, that man has eternal life, these words give clear replies to the enigma of my very being. The being of God, the life of God, the essence of God, these are all love.",
        
        "Heaven takes nothing without repaying immeasurably. We must not consider the suffering too great nor the joys too small.",

        "The more a person lives recollected in the interior of his soul, the stronger is that radiation which he sheds around him and which draws other souls into his circle.",
        
        "We have to learn to see others carry the cross and not be able to remove it from them. It is more difficult than to carry our own, but we cannot avoid it.",
        
        "Divine spirit, divine life, divine love means this: He who does the will of God knows God and loves Him. In fact, at the moment in which we do what God asks, with interior dedication, divine life becomes our life, God is found within ourselves.",
        
        "The more one endures in silence, the less one feels the wrong.",

        "The Lord is patient and has great mercy. In His economy, He knows how to profit even by our faults, if we deposit them on His altar.",
        
        "The place of everyone of us depends solely on our vocation. One's vocation is not found simply after having reflected and examined the various roads: it is a response which is obtained with prayer.",
        
        "There is a call to suffer with Christ, and through this call to collaborate with Him in His work of redemption. If we are united to the Lord, we are members of the mystical body of Christ...",
        
        "...Christ continues to live in His members and to suffer in them; and suffering, borne in union with the Lord, is suffering, grafted onto the great work of redemption, and through this it is fruitful.",
        
        "It is in the nature of things that before a decisive step, one thinks over what one is leaving and what one is going to face. It must be like that: one places oneself in the hands of God, without any human certainty, in order to relish a truer and more profound security.",
        
        "Nostalgia disappears when one's true homeland is reached.",
        
        "I am convinced that God does not call anyone solely for himself and moreover when He is pleased to accept the offering of a soul He is prodigal of demonstrations of love.",
        
        "I would like to come to the defense of the angels. They do not stand between us and God as a separation, but rather as a ray of light...The fact that God deals with us through messengers is not a sign of the unapproachable majesty of God, rather of (His) overflowing love.",
        
        "It is a great school of humility to have to do continually things that cause great fatigue and that turn our very imperfect.",
        
        "Let us confidently place all preoccupation about the future in the hands of God and let us allow Him to guide us like a child. After that, we may be sure that we will not be able to take the wrong road.",
        
        "This is the principle on which is based the life of all religious orders and first of all Carmel: through free and joyous suffering to intercede for sinners and to collaborate in the redemption of mankind.",
        
        "Our work in the midst of others will be efficacious and blessed by God only if we do not yield even one centimeter of the sure ground of our faith, and if we follow our conscience, without letting ourselves be influenced by human respect.",
        
        "The darker it becomes around us, the more we ought to open our hearts to the light that comes from on high.",
        
        "One must pray much to remain faithful in every circumstance, above all for the many who have to go through trials more arduous than mine and are not so anchored to eternity.",
        
        "I have no other desire than that the will of God be accomplished in me and through me.",
        
        "Under the cross, I have understood the destiny of God's people; I believe that those who understand that all this is the cross of Christ ought to take it up themselves in the name of all the others.",
        
        "I always think of Queen Esther, who was chosen from among her own people to intercede before the king for her people. I am a little Esther, poor and impotent, but the King who has chosen me is infinitely great and merciful. And this is  great consolation.",
        
        "The holy patrons of Carmel emphasize, to the consolation of those who are not inclined to mysticism, that what matters is to unite oneself to God in the will and that is to conform to the will of God.",
        
        "Faith in the secret history of souls ought to fortify us when what we see externally (in ourselves and in others) takes away our courage.",
        
        "The prayer of the Church is the prayer of the ever living Christ which has its model in Christ's prayer during His life as man.",
        
        "Jesus' life of prayer is the key that introduces us into the prayer of the Church.",
        
        "”Father, if you will, take this chalice from me, but not my will but yours be done.” These words are like a flash that for a moment illumines the most intimate life of Jesus' soul.",
        
        "Participation in the sacrifice and in communion transforms the soul into a living stone of the divine city and every city and every soul into a temple of God.",
        
        "One attains possession of a knowledge of the cross only when one experiences the cross to the very depths.",
        
        "The prayer of the Church is the prayer of the ever-living Christ, which has its model in Christ's prayer during His life as a man.",
        
        "The liturgical unity of the Church in heaven and of the Church on earth that renders thanks to God ”through Christ” finds its strongest expression in the Preface and in the Sanctus of the Mass.",
        
        "Everything of which we have need... is summarized in the seven petitions of the Our Father which the Lord did not say for Himself, but for our instruction.",
    
        "The priestly prayer of the Savior reveals the mystery of the interior life: the close union of the divine persons and the indwelling of God in the soul. In this secret depth, in hiddenness and in silence, the work of Redemption is prepared and accomplished,, and so it will be until the end of time, until the moment in which we will truly be one thing only in God." ,
        
       "The mystery of the Incarnation and the mystery of evil are closely connected; against the light come down from heaven, stands out darker and more sinister, the night of sin.",
        
        "For the present, we ought to listen in silence and let the divine word act until it moves us to praise God in prayer and in work." ,
        
        "Where we will be led on this earth we do not know, and we should not even ask about it beforehand. We know only that for those who love God all things work to their good. And besides, we know that the ways of the Lord go beyond this earth." ,
        
        "When we participate in the Holy Sacrifice, in Holy Communion, we nourish ourselves with the body and blood of Jesus. We become His body and His blood. Only in the measure in which we are members of His body can His Spirit animate us and reign in us." ,
        
        "He who is all eagerness to acquire and keep, loses. He who gives to God, gains.",
        
        "To be a child of God means to place oneself in the hands of God, to do God's will and not one's own, to deposit in the hands of God all preoccupations and hopes, and not to be troubled anymore about one's own future. This is the foundation of the liberty and joy of the children of God.",
        
        "The human nature that Christ assumed gave Him the possibility of suffering and dying. The divine nature possessed by Him from eternity gave to suffering and dying an infinite value and redemptive power.",
        
        "Whoever belongs to Christ ought to live the whole life of Christ; he ought to attain the maturity of Christ and finally should set out on the way of the cross, towards Gethsemane and Golgotha.",
        
        "The invocation, ”Thy will be done,” ought to be in its entirety the norm of the Christian life; it should regulate the course of the day from morning to evening, the direction of the soul and one's whole life, it ought to be the sole thought of the Christian.",
        
        "Let us consider the Mother of God as spouse: a silent, immense confidence, which in its turn expects an immense confidence; tacit obedience; faithful participation, open to sorrow; and all that in full adherence to the ordinance of God who gave her a man as earthly defense and visible head.",
        
        "Only the power of grace can truly root out and renew fallen nature in its inmost depths and not disguise it exteriorly.",
        
        "To give oneself to God, recklessly forgetful of self, not to take account of one's own individual life, to allow full room for divine life is the profound motive, the principle and the end of religious life. The more perfectly this is carried out, so much the richer is the divine life that fills the soul.",
        
        "In aridity and emptiness, the soul becomes humble. Former pride disappears when a man no longer finds anything in himself that might cause him to look down on others.",
        
        "The more lofty the degree of loving union to which God destines the soul, so much the more profound and persistent must be its purification.",
        
        "The soul attains a high degree of love of God, inasmuch as it acts solely according to His will. Perseverance though all misfortunes confers strength and courage on it. The painful purification from all sensible desires and pleasures leads it to freedom spirit of which the twelve fruits of the Holy Spirit mature.",
        
        "(Faith) furnishes a certain but obscure knowledge to the understanding. In fact, it shows us God as inaccessible light, as incomprehensible and infinite Being before whom every natural force gives way. And it is just for this motive that faith reduces reason to its intrinsic nothingness: to the realization of its importance and the grandeur of God." ,
        
        
        "Charity liberates the will from everything, imposing as a duty to love God above all else. This however is possible only when anxious desire for creatures is removed.",
        
        "The activity by which the soul assimilates the contents of faith is meditation.",
        
        "To obtain the granting of requests that we have at heart, there is no better mean than that of directing our energy to our prayer to asking for what is most pleasing to God.",
        
        "The Cross serves as a walking-stick to speed one's march toward the summit.",
        
        "The more limpid and pure the divine ray that penetrates the soul, so much greater is the darkness, the emptiness and the annihilation.",
        
        "The soul ought to consider aridity and darkness as fortunate omens, as signs that God is beside it, freeing it from itself, taking the initiative out of its hand." ,
        
        "The higher the soul rises toward God, the lower it sinks into itself.  Union takes place in the interior of the soul, in its most profound depth",
        
        "The right of self-determination is an inalienable property of the soul. It constitutes the great mystery of personal liberty, before which God Himself is halted.",
        
        "God dwells in the inmost depths of the soul and therefore there is nothing within it that is hidden from Him." ,
        
        "Man is called to live in his inmost being, taking in hand the direction of his entire self. Only by directing himself from here can man find his allotted place in the world.",
        
        "God desires dominion over created spirits only under the form of a free gift offered to Him from their love.",
        
        "He who does not hold the reigns of his whole being tightly in his hand is not at all at the height where he can make his decisions with true freedom: On the contrary, he will always be subject to exterior influences.",
        
        "The inmost depth of the soul is the center of the most perfect liberty.",
        
        "He who with blind faith no longer desires anything except in so far as God wills it has at last reached the highest stage attainable by man, supported by the grace of God.",
        
        "Love, it its highest expression, is a fusion of being in a mutual and voluntary surrender. Such is the intimate trinitarian life of God.",
        
        "Living faith is the firm conviction that God exists, an acceptance as true of all that He has revealed, a loving promptness to let oneself be guided by the will of God." ,
        
        "Faith is referred to as midnight darkness, because in order to gain its light, we are obliged to renounce completely the light of natural knowledge." ,
        
        "The flame of divine life touches the soul with the tenderness of God and wounds it in its inmost depth with such force as to make it dissolve in love.",
        
        "The more profoundly one is immersed in God, so much the more is obliged to go out of self, that is to go toward the world, to bear it into the divine life." ,
        
        "As for what concerns our relations with our fellow men, the anguish in our neighbor's soul must break all precept. All that we do is a means to an end, but love is an end in itself, because God is love.",
        
        "In the heart of Jesus, which was pierced, the kingdom of heaven and the land of earth are bound together. Here is for us the source of life. This heart is the heart of the Triune Divinity, and the center of all human hearts ... it draws us to itself with secret power, it conceals us in itself in the Father's bosom and floods us with the Holy Spirit. This heart, it beats for us in a small tabernacle where it remains mysteriously hidden in that still, white host.",
