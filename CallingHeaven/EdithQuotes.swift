        "This is the life of faith: God who manifests Himself as He who is, as Creator, as Upholder; and when the Savior said he who believes in the Son, that man has eternal life, these words give clear replies to the enigma of my very being.

        "Divine spirit, divine life, divine love means this: he who does the will of God knows God and loves Him. In fact, at the moment in which we do what God asks, with interior dedication, divine life becomes our life, God is found within ourselves.",

        "It is in the nature of things that before a decisive step, one thinks over what one is leaving and what one is going to face. It must be like that: one places oneself in the hands of God, without any human certainty, in order to relish a truer and more profound security.",
        
        "Nostalgia disappears when one's true homeland is reached.",
        
        "I am convinced that God does not call anyone solely for himself and moreover when He is pleased to accept the offering of a soul He is prodigal of demonstrations of love.",
        
        "I would like to come to the defense of the angels. They do not stand between us and God as a separation, but rather as a ray of light...The fact that God deals with us through messengers is not a sign of the unapproachable majesty of God, rather of (His) overflowing love.",

        "When we participate in the Holy Sacrifice, in Holy Communion, we nourish ourselves with the body and blood of Jesus. We become His body and His blood. Only in the measure in which we are members of His body can His Spirit animate us and reign in us." ,
        
        "He who is all eagerness to acquire and keep, loses. He who gives to God, gains.",
        
        "To be a child of God means to place oneself in the hands of God, to do God's will and not one's own, to deposit in the hands of God all preoccupations and hopes, and not to be troubled anymore about one's own future. This is the foundation of the liberty and joy of the children of God.",
        
        "The human nature that Christ assumed gave Him the possibility of suffering and dying. The divine nature possessed by Him from eternity gave to suffering and dying an infinite value and redemptive power.",
        
        "Whoever belongs to Christ ought to live the whole life of Christ; he ought to attain the maturity of Christ and finally should set out on the way of the cross, towards Gethsemane and Golgotha.",
        
        "The invocation, ”Thy will be done,” ought to be in its entirety the norm of the Christian life; it should regulate the course of the day from morning to evening, the direction of the soul and one's whole life, it ought to be the sole thought of the Christian.",

        "To give oneself to God, recklessly forgetful of self, not to take account of one's own individual life, to allow full room for divine life is the profound motive, the principle and the end of religious life. The more perfectly this is carried out, so much the richer is the divine life that fills the soul.",
        
        "In aridity and emptiness, the soul becomes humble. Former pride disappears when a man no longer finds anything in himself that might cause him to look down on others.",
        
        "The more lofty the degree of loving union to which God destines the soul, so much the more profound and persistent must be its purification.",
        
        "The soul attains a high degree of love of God, inasmuch as it acts solely according to His will. Perseverance though all misfortunes confers strength and courage on it. The painful purification from all sensible desires and pleasures leads it to freedom spirit of which the twelve fruits of the Holy Spirit mature.",
        
        "(Faith) furnishes a certain but obscure knowledge to the understanding. In fact, it shows us God as inaccessible light, as incomprehensible and infinite Being before whom every natural force gives way. And it is just for this motive that faith reduces reason to its intrinsic nothingness: to the realization of its importance and the grandeur of God." ,

        "The more limpid and pure the divine ray that penetrates the soul, so much greater is the darkness, the emptiness and the annihilation.",
        
        "The soul ought to consider aridity and darkness as fortunate omens, as signs that God is beside it, freeing it from itself, taking the initiative out of its hand." ,
        
        "The higher the soul rises toward God, the lower it sinks into itself.  Union takes place in the interior of the soul, in its most profound depth",
        
        "The right of self-determination is an inalienable property of the soul. It constitutes the great mystery of personal liberty, before which God Himself is halted.",

        "Love, it its highest expression, is a fusion of being in a mutual and voluntary surrender. Such is he intimate trinitarian life of God.",

        "As for what concerns our relations with our fellow men, the anguish in our neighbor's soul must break all precept. All that we do is a means to an end, but love is an end in itself, because God is love.",
        
        "In the heart of Jesus, which was pierced, the kingdom of heaven and the land of earth are bound together. Here is for us the source of life. This heart is the heart of the Triune Divinity, and the center of all human hearts ... it draws us to itself with secret power, it conceals us in itself in the Father's bosom and floods us with the Holy Spirit. This heart, it beats for us in a small tabernacle where it remains mysteriously hidden in that still, white host.",
