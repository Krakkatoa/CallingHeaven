        "Faith is a dark night for man, but in this very way it gives him light.",
        "Time is but a shadow, a dream. Already God sees us in glory and takes joy in our eternal beatitude. How this thought helps my soul! I understand then why He lets us suffer.",

To those who suffer wounds in fighting his battles God opens his arms in loving, tender friendship. That is why he (Christ) tells us that if we want to join him, we shall travel the way he took.

        //95

        "Mine are the heavens and mine is the earth. Mine are the nations, the just are mine, and mine the sinners. The angels are mine, and the Mother of God, and all things are mine; and God himself is mine and for me, because Christ is mine and all for me. What do you ask, then, and seek, my soul? Yours is all of this, and all is for you. Do not engage yourself in anything less or pay heed to the crumbs that fall from your Father’s table. Go forth and exult in your Glory! Hide yourself in it and rejoice, and you will obtain the supplications of your heart.",
        
        "With the divinest Word, the Virgin, made pregnant, down the road comes walking, if you'll grant her a room in your abode.",
        
        "O soul, most beautiful of creatures, who so earnestly longs to know the place where your Beloved is, that you may seek him and be united to him.  You are yourself the very tabernacle where he dwells, the secret chamber of his retreat where he is hidden.  Rejoice therefore and exult, because all your good and all your hope is so near you as to be within you. Yes, rather rejoice that you cannot be without it, for lo ;the kingdom of God is within you;.  So says the Bridegroom himself, and his servant St. Paul adds: ”You are the temple of the living God.”  What joy for the soul to learn that God never abandons it even in mortal sin, how much less in a state of grace:  What more can you desire, what more  can you seek outside, seeing that within you you have your riches, your delight, your Beloved whom you seek and desire.",
        
        "One love in them all makes of them one Lover,\n and the Lover is the Beloved in whom each one lives.\n For the being that the three possess each of them possesses,\n and each of them loves him who bears this being.\n Each one is this being, which alone unites them,\n binding them deeply, one beyond words.",
        
        "Who can free themselves from lowly manners and limitations if you do not lift them to yourself, my God, in purity of love? How will human beings begotten and nurtured in lowliness rise up to you, Lord, if you do not raise them with your hand that made them?",
        
        "Mine are the heavens and  mine is the earth; mine are the people, the righteous are mine and mine are the sinners; the angels are mine and the Mother of God, and all things are mine; and God Himself is mine and for me, for Christ is mine and all for me. What then do you ask for and seek, my soul? Yours is all this, and it is all for you. ",
        
        "The Father spoke one Word, which was His Son, and this Word He speaks always in eternal silence, and in silence must it be heard by the soul.",
