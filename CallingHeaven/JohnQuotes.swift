        "The soul that is attached to anything, however much good there may be in it, will not arrive at the liberty of divine union. For whether it be a strong wire rope or a slender and delicate thread that holds the bird, it matters not, if it really holds it fast; for, until the cord be broken the bird cannot fly",
        
        "To saints, their very slumber is a prayer.",

        "The soul that is clouded by the desires is darkened in the understanding and allows neither the sun of natural reason nor that of the supernatural Wisdom of God to shine upon it and illumine it clearly.",
        
        "Faith is a dark night for man, but in this very way it gives him light.",
        "Time is but a shadow, a dream. Already God sees us in glory and takes joy in our eternal beatitude. How this thought helps my soul! I understand then why He lets us suffer.",

        "Do not feed your soul on anything apart from God. Cast away all cares and let peace and recollection fill your heart.",
        
        "The road is narrow. He who wishes to travel it more easily must cast off all things and use the cross as his cane. In other words, he must be truly resolved to suffer willingly for the love of God in all things.",

        "It is best to learn to silence the faculties and to cause them to be still, so that God may speak.",
        
        "Dear brothers and sisters, I pray God may open your eyes and let you see what hidden treasures he bestows on us in the trials from which the world thinks only to flee. Shame turns into honor when we seek God's glory. Present affliction become the source of heavenly glory. To those who suffer wounds in fighting his battles God opens his arms in loving, tender friendship. That is why he (Christ) tells us that if we want to join him, we shall travel the way he took. It is surely not right that the Son of God should go his way on the path of shame while the sons of men walk the way of worldly honor: 'The disciple is not above his teacher, nor the servant greater than his master.'",
        
        "God passes through the thicket of the world, and wherever His glance falls He turns all things to beauty.",

        "Love unites the soul with God; and the more love the soul has, the more powerfully it enters into God and is centered on Him.",
        
        "The center of the soul is God. When the soul loves and understands and enjoys God to its utmost capacity, it will have reached its deep center, God.",
        
        "Here the soul rejoices in the glory of God, under the protection of His shadow. It is immersed in the waters of the Divinity which freely penetrate the whole person.",
        
        "When the soul offers the sacrifice of love, it becomes living flames of fire. If we consider that the soul is transformed in God, it will be understood how, in some manner, it has in truth become a fountain of living water, boiling and burning in the fire of love- God Himself.",
        
        "He joyfully reveals His face to you, saying to you, 'I am yours, completely yours. And my happiness is to be who I am so that I may give Myself to you and be all yours.”",
        
        "The soul must be attached to nothing, whether sense or spirit, which would introduce noise into the deep silence. There, the voice of God speaks to the heart in this secret place, in utmost peace and tranquility.",
        
        "Let the soul then leave itself in the hands of God and have confidence in Him. Let it not trust itself to the hands and works of others, for if it stays in God's care, it will certainly make progress.",
        
        "How impossible it is for a soul to judge the things of God aright! To do so, it must completely get rid of its desires and pleasures apart from God.",
        
        "The light of grace which God gives to the soul, opening its eyes to behold the divine life, and making it pleasing to himself, calls to ever greater depths of grace, which will ultimately transform the soul in God.",
        
        "Wait upon God with loving and pure attentiveness, working no violence on yourself, lest you disturb the soul's peace and tranquility. God will feed your soul with heavenly food since you put no obstacle in His way.",
        
        "How gently and lovingly you awaken in my heart, where you dwell secretly and alone. And in your sweet breathing, filled with blessing and glory, you tenderly inspire me with love.",
        
        "Do not feed your spirit on anything apart from God. Cast away all cares and let peace and recollection fill your heart.",
        
        "He then that seeks happiness in other things is not keeping himself empty for God to fill with his own unspeakable joy.",
        
        "As a man goes to God so does he leave Him; and if his hands are full, he cannot take into the what God wants to give.",
        
        "Live in faith and hope, even though you are in darkness, for in this darkness, God enfolds the soul. Cast your cares upon God, for you are His, and He will never forget you.",
        
        "The immense benefits of God can only be contained by empty and solitary hearts. Therefore, our Lord, who loves you greatly, wishes you to be quite alone, for he desires to be your only companion.",
        
        "Mine are the heavens and mine is the earth. Mine are the nations, the just are mine, and mine the sinners. The angels are mine, and the Mother of God, and all things are mine; and God himself is mine and for me, because Christ is mine and all for me. What do you ask, then, and seek, my soul? Yours is all of this, and all is for you. Do not engage yourself in anything less or pay heed to the crumbs that fall from your Father’s table. Go forth and exult in your Glory! Hide yourself in it and rejoice, and you will obtain the supplications of your heart.",
        
        "With the divinest Word, the Virgin, made pregnant, down the road comes walking, if you'll grant her a room in your abode.",
        
        "O soul, most beautiful of creatures, who so earnestly longs to know the place where your Beloved is, that you may seek him and be united to him.  You are yourself the very tabernacle where he dwells, the secret chamber of his retreat where he is hidden.  Rejoice therefore and exult, because all your good and all your hope is so near you as to be within you. Yes, rather rejoice that you cannot be without it, for lo, the kingdom of God is within you.  So says the Bridegroom himself, and his servant St. Paul adds, ”You are the temple of the living God.”  What joy for the soul to learn that God never abandons it even in mortal sin, how much less in a state of grace:  What more can you desire, what more  can you seek outside, seeing that within you you have your riches, your delight, your Beloved whom you seek and desire.",
    
        "One love in them all makes of them one Lover, and the Lover is the Beloved in whom each one lives. For the being that the three possess each of them possesses, and each of them loves him who bears this being. Each one is this being, which alone unites them, binding them deeply, one beyond words.",
        
        "Who can free themselves from lowly manners and limitations if you do not lift them to yourself, my God, in purity of love? How will human beings begotten and nurtured in lowliness rise up to you, Lord, if you do not raise them with your hand that made them?",
    
        
        "The Father spoke one Word, which was His Son, and this Word He speaks always in eternal silence, and in silence must it be heard by the soul.",
